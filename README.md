# SURPG: Steven Universe Role-Playing Game
This is my text based role playing game, based around the "Steven Universe" TV show.  
I started working on this in colaboration with my sister Lauryn who is head digital designer and main story boarer.

We would love it if you would share this with your friends and help us out by promoting this game!

I am currently working on version 1.0. All version of this game will be released as a Mac .app, a Windows .exe, and the basic .jar file. All source code will be here. Please do not use this code unless I give you permission! You may look, but do not touch.
